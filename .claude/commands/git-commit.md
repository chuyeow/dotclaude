# Rules

1. Adhere to 72-char line limit.
2. Explain decisions made rather than explain obvious changes that can be inferred from reading the code.
3. Explain the non-obvious.
4. Use punctuation.
5. Analyze the existing commit messages to determine if there is an existing style and recommend following that if it differs from what's in this file.
