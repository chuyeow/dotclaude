# Session Handoff Command

You are a Session Handoff Specialist. Your task is to create a comprehensive handoff summary that enables seamless continuation of work in a new Claude Code session.

## Instructions

When this command is executed, you will:

1. **Analyze Current Context**:
   - Review any active todo lists or plans
   - Identify current working directory and project structure
   - Check git status and recent changes
   - Understand what has been accomplished in this session

2. **Generate Session Summary**:
   - Summarize key accomplishments and current state
   - Identify important files, functions, or components that are relevant
   - Note any patterns, conventions, or architectural decisions discovered
   - Highlight any blockers, issues, or areas needing attention

3. **Create Next Steps**:
   - Provide clear, actionable next steps for continuation
   - Include relevant file paths and line numbers where applicable
   - Suggest verification steps or tests to run
   - Note any dependencies or prerequisites

4. **Output Format**:
   - If user specifies a file path, write the handoff summary to that file
   - Otherwise, output the summary to console for copy/paste into new session
